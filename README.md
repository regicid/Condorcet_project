# Code repository of the paper *Why does individual learning endure when crowds are wiser?* (de Courson, Fitouchi, Benzaquen & Bouchaud, 2020)

The classs.py file contains the class to simulate the model. We kept the paper's notations. The model_handling notebook shows hos to play with it. The Plot_figures notebook has the code to replicate the figures (with the plotted objects in the Objects_to_plot folder).
